This post is a reading note based on *Race after Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code by Ruha Benjamin; Introduction, Chapters 1-2*, which is recommended by UMSI as part of common reading experience in Fall 2021. I'm aiming at reflect on novel lines and concepts, and share my thinking upon them.

# Black celebrities
Ruha states in the book that the popularity of Black celebrities in the US is a concealed discrimination. This explanation fits in my instinct that the virality of Black stars like Rihanna, including non-Black's simulation to their behaviors, implies disrespect and novelty hunting. A reasonable explanation is similar to another concept raised in this book: behaviors and wording considered to be *Blacked* are also considered **abnormal and unhealthy**. It reveals White supremacy in the society, where Blacks share the same language and habits with Whites, but their differences are still under scrutiny.

However, White supremacy cannot explain the phenomenon that Asians or Latinxs are also keen on Black celebrities. We can state that it is out of the impact of Whites' preference and dominance in the society. This assertation, unfortunately, denigrates other ethnicity to be blind and unconscious, and also erases their existence in the world of diversity. Sounds like an echo: the expression of *White supremacy* is also a kind of White supremacy, for it simplifies the complex caste concerning inequity into *the Whites and the Others*. Another explanation is that the history of Whites as celebrities is familiar and natural to people, and the emergence of Black celebrities is novel, chasing after them symbols vogue among teens.
