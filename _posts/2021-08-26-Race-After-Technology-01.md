This post is a reading note based on *Race after Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code by Ruha Benjamin; Introduction, Chapters 1-2*, which is recommended by UMSI as part of common reading experience in Fall 2021. I'm aiming at reflect on novel lines and concepts, and share my thinking upon them.

# Black celebrities
Ruha states in the book that the popularity of Black celebrities in the US is a concealed discrimination. This explanation fits in my instinct that the virality of Black stars like Rihanna, including the simulation to their behaviors from non-Blacks, implies disrespect and novelty hunting. A reasonable explanation is similar to another concept raised in this book: behaviors and wording considered to be *Blacked* are also considered **abnormal and unhealthy**. It reveals White supremacy in the society, where Blacks share the same language and habits with Whites, but their differences are still under scrutiny.
