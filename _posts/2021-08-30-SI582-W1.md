A reading response to *Chapter 1* of the textbook, *Kelley's brainstorm* lesson, and a paper on *Designing in the Margins*.

# Cooperation

The first time I got in touch with user experience design and research, when I got to know that it encourages people from different backgrounds to involve, I kept wondering that how does it work? How could it work? According to my experience, it's even impossible for students in different majors to cooperate smoothly. The differences in culture, gender, and specialzation, shape the way we think about the physical and intellectual world. Just as the author points out in *Chapter 1.3.2: Who Is Involved in Interaction Design*, the complexity of a team turns out to be a crux in groupworks. However, as one always stands in their fixed viewpoint, a successful human-centered design does demand voices from the crowd. From my perspective, the solution to which is that every participant shouldn't pre-assume themselves to be expertises.To discuss and solve with characteristic concepts but without characteristics, and treat othersâ€™ ideas in a humble mood. The same thing happens to the process of brainstorming: in Tom Kelley's lesson, he gives several DOs and DO NOTs. He said also "don't be an "expert" snob", and I'd like to add that don't prioritize every techinical advice.

In fact, arrogance is the Achilles' Heel in designing, from my perspective.
