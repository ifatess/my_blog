A reading response to *Chapter 1* of the textbook, *Kelley's brainstorm* lesson, and a paper on *Designing in the Margins*.

# Intro to Interaction Design & My Experience

The first time I got in touch with user experience design and research, when I got to know that it encourages people from different backgrounds to involve, I kept wondering that how does it work? How could it work? According to my experience, it's even impossible for students in different majors to cooperate smoothly. The differences in culture, gender, and specialzation, shape the way we think about the physical and intellectual world. Just as the author points out in *Chapter 1.3.2: Who Is Involved in Interaction Design*, the complexity of a team turns out to be a crux in groupworks. However, as one always stands in their fixed viewpoint, a successful human-centered design does demand voices from the crowd.
