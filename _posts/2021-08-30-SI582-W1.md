A reading response to *Chapter 1* of the textbook, *Kelley's brainstorm* lesson, and a paper on *Designing in the Margins*.

# Cooperation

The first time I got in touch with user experience design and research, when I got to know that it encourages people from different backgrounds to involve, I kept wondering that how does it work? How could it work? According to my experience, it's even impossible for students in different majors to cooperate smoothly. The differences in culture, gender, and specialzation, shape the way we think about the physical and intellectual world. Just as the author points out in *Chapter 1.3.2: Who Is Involved in Interaction Design*, the complexity of a team turns out to be a crux in groupworks. However, as one always stands in their fixed viewpoint, a successful human-centered design does demand voices from the crowd. From my perspective, the solution to which is that every participant shouldn't pre-assume themselves to be expertises. To discuss and solve with characteristic concepts but without characteristics, and treat othersâ€™ ideas in a humble mood. The same thing happens to the process of brainstorming: in Tom Kelley's lesson, he gives several DOs and DO NOTs. He said also "don't be an "expert" snob", and I'd like to add that don't prioritize every techinical advice.

In fact, arrogance is the Achilles' Heel in designing, from my perspective. When I was a computer science student, I was always confused about the discrimination towards those who majored in liberal arts and fine arts in my class. My classmates mocked at the way they wrote: they used Microsoft Word rather than Markdown or LaTeX, and rich text editors were considered clumsy and a sign of low intelligence. However, rich text editors are somehow the mainstream writing tools in our daily life, and millions of engineers are making efforts to polish and evolute them. Even in the field of computer science, the underlying DOS system has been replaced by intuitive and graphical operating systems. Imagine what happens if arrogance rooted deeply into the mind of the first generation of computer engineers? Rather than obeying a professional and high threshold criteria strictly, technologist should think in a more natural way while designing and building.
