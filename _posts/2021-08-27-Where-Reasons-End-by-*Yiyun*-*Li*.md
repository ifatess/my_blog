This post contains extracts from *Yiyun Li*'s book: Where Reasons End. 

> What if life could be saved by cliches? What if life must be lived by cliches? Somewhere tomorrow and somewhere yesterday--never somewhere today but cliche-land.  
  -- Page 9

> It's not your fault, he said.  
  If you use fault in the sense of wrongdoing, I said, no, it's not. But the root of the word fault came from to disappoint, to deceive.

> You're being silly, like English teachers always asking us to look for metaphors in the text, Nikolai said.  
  -- Page 24

> Where I last saw you, he said.  
  That line should be mine, I thought.  
  Mine, too, he said.  
  -- Page 32

> I've started to understand the point of them, I said. They take up space, they distract, they make the difficult less difficult, they even fluff things up a little. And they can be a shortcut, too, the ladders, you know.

> Cold, wet, soles of our shoes slippery, our fingers numb, what could we catch? Any seasoned parent was an expert at catching: toppling babies, somersaulting spoons, half-eaten bananas and apples, half-ripe blood berries. Everything breakable and unbreakable belonged to a parent's field, but what could I catch on this gray, wet morning? Not the smile on your face, not a blue cat, not a purple penguin, not dust in the wind, not a thought whispering in your ears, so loud that it had drowned out all the music of the world. What, my child, can I catch now, when all has become invisible?  
  Words, mother dear, Nikolai said. We will be catching each other's words, don't you see?

 I felt more than attached to *Li*'s words, since the first time I read her works. The way she chooses synonyms, arranges sentences, and manages pieces, is acquainted with my personal experiences, unfortunately, in her abandoned and still struggling to get rid of, Chinese. Every time I'm reading an article written in English, I sensed that there is a blank inserted between us, between my eyes and the screen, my brain and the author's mood. That gives the reason why I was no less deeply moved by *Li*'s novel, even deeper than ever I read something in my mother tongue. Mirroring in English, I found my reading experience appeared exotic, even alien that thoughts jumped into my mind rather that I came up with them.
